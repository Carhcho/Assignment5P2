Assignment5 Programming 2
---------------------------------------------------------------

Create a program that will prompt the user for a file name to work with. Then prompt the user for a string to search for. The program will search the file for the string the user provided, each line in the file is a string. So a line should be read from the file, search the line for the string. If the string is in that line then it should display the line. If the string is not in the line then it should read the next line from the file. The program should also keep track of how many times it found the string and how many lines from the file it has read completely. Provide the text file you created for this program.

Revisions: 10/03/2021 I was confused about the prompt it wanted me to search the whole text or if it just wanted to print the first occurrence and stop there, so I kinda did both.
